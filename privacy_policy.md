# PRIVACY POLICY FOR My BeBot ALEXA SKILLS

We take privacy VERY Seriously. As such we wrote this privacy policy in order to help describe how A.D. Solutions (Advanced Document Solutions) (“A.D. Solutions”, “us” or “we”) protects your (“you”, “the user”) privacy and your data. Before using any of our Alexa Skills (“our skills”), please read this policy, as well as the Alexa [Terms of Use](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201809740) and the [Privacy Policies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GX7NJQ4ZB8MHFRNJ) by the Amazon Digital Services LLC (with its affiliates, “Amazon”).

Regarding Amazon, “Alexa” means their Alexa Voice Service which includes third party services (like our skills) and other related Software.

If you use one of our skills you fully agree to this privacy policy. 

# GENERAL

When you use our skills you have to talk to Alexa. This voice input is sent to Amazon and us where we use it to understand what our skill should do for you. This is absolutely necessary for our service to give you an appropriate answer.

# DATA

We never collect or share personal data with our skills.

To improve our services we analyze automatically how often utterances are spoken and other analytics. This is done automatically by Amazon in the Amazon Developer Portal.

For some of our skills, it is necessary to save data for you in our databases. This data is only connected to the name uttered in your alexa skill request and is only logged with the service call you create in order to provide accurate and timely service. Again, this is not shared with anyone outside of our organization.

# CHANGES

Our skills or parts of it may change or be updated at any time. Further, this Privacy Policy might change. You can find a link to this policy on the description page of the skill in the Alexa App or in the Alexa Store. Your continued use of our skill after changes of the Privacy Policy or the skill itself will be seen as your acceptance of both.

# THANK YOU

I thank you for the use and utilization of My BeBot for good. Together let's build a better future.

Made With Love
